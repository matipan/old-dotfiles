dotfiles
========

This is my Vim/Tmux setup, using zsh terminal with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) framework. I'm constantly updating this repo. If you are new to vim i recommend that you use it as an example instead of cloning it. If you already have a config setup and you're thinking of changing it, give this one a try!!!!

Here are a couple of pictures with vim, tmux and some plugins
